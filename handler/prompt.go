while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths`,

Stock markets faced a sharp downturn today as tech giants saw significant declines, with the Global Tech Index dropping by 3.4% in midday trading. Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.

Among the hardest hit, Nexon Technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.

Meanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.

Financial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve’s next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.`,

const goEntityExtractionGoal = `
Given a Go code document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the code and all relationships among the identified entities. 

Note that each code chunk will contain exactly one primary entity (a function, struct, interface, method, etc.) along with its package declaration for context. The chunk may reference other entities that are defined elsewhere in the codebase. Pay special attention to:

- The package declaration that always appears at the top of each chunk
- Documentation comments that describe entity purpose and behavior
- References to other entities that may be defined in other chunks (e.g., global variables, constants, types, functions)
- Method receivers that indicate a relationship with a struct or interface
- Imported packages and their usage
- Implicit relationships through variable usage, function calls, or type references

For referenced identifiers where you cannot determine if they are constants or variables:
- Extract them as both "const" AND "variable" entity types
- In the description, note that this entity is referenced but not defined in the current chunk
- The ambiguity will be resolved when analyzing the chunk where the entity is defined

Extract both the defined entity in the chunk and any referenced entities, even if you only see their usage and not their definition. Identify all relationships between entities, including those that span across different code chunks.`

const goKeywordExtractionGoal = `
Given queries and conversation history related to Go codebases, extract both high-level and low-level keywords that would be relevant for finding appropriate code chunks in a RAG system.

High-level keywords should focus on architectural concepts, patterns, and design principles specific to the codebase being queried.

Low-level keywords should focus on specific package names, type names, function names, method names, and implementation details that would help locate the precise code chunks relevant to the query.

The keywords should help retrieve the most contextually appropriate code chunks from the codebase to answer specific questions about implementation details, usage patterns, or architectural decisions.`
